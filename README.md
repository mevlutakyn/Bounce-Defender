Bounce Defender is a fast-paced 2D physics-based game built with SpriteKit. 
The objective of the game is to keep the ball in play by bouncing it off a wooden platform, preventing it from falling off the screen. 
The ball reacts to the position of the platform, and its direction and speed are determined by where it hits the surface.
The more accurately you hit the ball, the better your chances of keeping it in play!

As the game progresses and your score increases, the game speed accelerates, making the gameplay more challenging.
The ball bounces higher and faster, testing your reflexes and your ability to control the platform.
